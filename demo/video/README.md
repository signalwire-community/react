# Demo/Playground for the components

Before you start, please fill in the `sample.env` file in this folder and move it to `.env` so you have your SignalWire tokens in place.

## To run

Assuming you have the rest of the repo set up, to run the demo you do:

1. `npm install`
2. `npx vite`

If you get an error about not being able to find `@signalwire-community/react` make sure you have followed the readme at the root of this repo, and that rollup has run once.
